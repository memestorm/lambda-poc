# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simulated AWS Lambda federation running locally using Docker and AWS Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE). The system consists of five Java-based Lambda functions that maintain consensus on a global count value through SQS message passing. The federation provides fault tolerance through quorum-based recovery mechanisms when individual lambdas are restarted.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run five Lambda functions locally in Docker containers, so that I can simulate a distributed Lambda federation without AWS infrastructure costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN five separate Docker containers SHALL be created, each running a Java Lambda function with AWS RIE
2. WHEN a container is started THEN the Lambda function SHALL initialize and be ready to receive messages within 30 seconds
3. WHEN the system is running THEN each Lambda SHALL have a unique identifier for federation membership
4. IF a Lambda container fails to start THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available Lambdas

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Lambdas to communicate exclusively through local SQS queues, so that the system mimics real AWS Lambda-to-Lambda communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN local SQS queues SHALL be created for inter-Lambda communication
2. WHEN a Lambda needs to send a message THEN it SHALL use SQS APIs to send messages to other Lambdas
3. WHEN a Lambda receives a message THEN it SHALL process the message through the SQS polling mechanism
4. IF SQS is unavailable THEN Lambdas SHALL retry message operations with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Lambdas to maintain consensus on a global count value, so that the federation demonstrates distributed state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all Lambdas SHALL initialize with a count value of 0
2. WHEN a count update is triggered THEN all Lambdas SHALL eventually converge to the same count value
3. WHEN consensus is reached THEN each Lambda SHALL log the agreed-upon count value
4. IF consensus cannot be reached within 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL log a consensus failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trigger count updates through direct messages, so that I can test the consensus mechanism on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a direct message is sent to any Lambda THEN it SHALL initiate a count increment operation
2. WHEN a count increment starts THEN the receiving Lambda SHALL propose the new count to all other Lambdas
3. WHEN other Lambdas receive a count proposal THEN they SHALL validate and respond with acceptance or rejection
4. WHEN consensus is achieved THEN all Lambdas SHALL update their local count and confirm the operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Lambdas to exchange messages for count updates and confirmations, so that the system maintains consistency across all nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Lambda proposes a count change THEN it SHALL send proposal messages to all other federation members
2. WHEN a Lambda receives a proposal THEN it SHALL respond within 10 seconds with accept or reject
3. WHEN a majority of Lambdas accept a proposal THEN the proposing Lambda SHALL send commit messages to all members
4. WHEN a Lambda receives a commit message THEN it SHALL update its local count and acknowledge the commit

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stopped Lambdas to recover the current count when restarted, so that the federation maintains consistency despite individual node failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Lambda restarts THEN it SHALL request the current count from all available federation members
2. WHEN recovery requests are sent THEN at least 3 out of 5 Lambdas SHALL respond for a valid quorum
3. WHEN quorum responses are received THEN the restarting Lambda SHALL adopt the majority count value
4. IF insufficient responses are received THEN the Lambda SHALL retry recovery up to 3 times before failing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want appropriate quorum rules for recovery operations, so that the system maintains consistency even with multiple simultaneous failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fewer than 3 Lambdas are available THEN recovery operations SHALL be rejected
2. WHEN exactly 3 Lambdas are available THEN recovery SHALL require unanimous agreement
3. WHEN 4 or more Lambdas are available THEN recovery SHALL require simple majority agreement
4. IF quorum cannot be established THEN the recovering Lambda SHALL enter a waiting state and retry every 30 seconds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Lambdas to output their status and operations to logs, so that I can monitor the federation behavior without a web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Lambda operation occurs THEN it SHALL log the operation with timestamp and Lambda ID
2. WHEN consensus is reached THEN all Lambdas SHALL log the final count value
3. WHEN a Lambda starts or stops THEN it SHALL log its federation membership status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN Lambdas SHALL log detailed error information including context and retry attempts
